Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the
avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and
only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd
say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal

selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity
and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is
truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike
down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt
to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I
lay My vengeance upon thee.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a
pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the
strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing.
She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
